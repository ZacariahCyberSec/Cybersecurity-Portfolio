# Cybersecurity Portfolio

Welcome to my Cybersecurity Portfolio. This repository contains scripts, reports, and projects showcasing my hands-on experience and skills in cybersecurity analysis, threat detection, and incident response.

## About Me

I am Tinashe Zacariah Nyandoro, a passionate cybersecurity learner focused on practical skills using tools like Python, Termux, and threat intelligence tracking.

## Projects & Scripts

- **Log Analysis**: Python scripts that parse system logs to detect failed login attempts and potential brute-force attacks.
- **Threat Tracker**: Automated script that fetches the latest cybersecurity news and threat actor updates.
- **Email Alerts**: Automated email notifications for security events.
- **Reports**: Generated summary reports of suspicious activity for risk assessment.

## How to Use

Clone this repository and run the Python scripts on your environment. Most scripts require Python 3 and the `yagmail` package for email notifications.
