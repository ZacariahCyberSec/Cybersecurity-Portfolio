# üõ°Ô∏è Cybersecurity Portfolio by Tinashe Zacariah (ZacariahCyberSec)

Welcome to my hands-on Cybersecurity Portfolio built entirely using Python and Termux on Android. This project simulates a real-world Security Operations Center (SOC) environment where logs are analyzed for brute force attacks, failed logins, and threat alerts are generated and emailed automatically.

## üöÄ Overview

This portfolio demonstrates skills in:
- Log file parsing
- Brute-force attack detection
- Email alert automation
- Threat reporting
- Git & GitHub version control
